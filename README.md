These are all accomplishments I achieved doing this course https://spring.academy/courses/building-a-rest-api-with-spring-boot

- I’ve delved into REST and the lore of HTTP verbs: not just GET, but also PUT, PATCH, and POST.
- I've used HTTP response status codes as designed: not just 200 OK, but 204 NO CONTENT and 201 CREATED as well.
- By using Spring Boot, I’ve now got a solid understanding of Spring. I learned about its Inversion of Control container, how to use annotations, and how to employ auto-configuration to free me from configuration tasks.
- I built the API using a layered architecture. I understand how Spring Security sits at the “front” of the API, Spring Web enables HTTP communications between the API and its clients, and Spring Data handles reading and writing to/from the relational data store.
- I used a test-first approach to provide confidence that my application works as designed while driving out my app's functionality.
- I drove my implementation using a Steel Thread - exercising all the integration points and validating my architecture early on to de-risk my functionality.
- I used the Red, Green, Refactor process to improve my code (and tests!) throughout the application development.
